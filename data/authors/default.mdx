Hi I'm Eoin, an Irish guy in Valencia. Currently I'm a co-founder of [Kyso](https://kyso.io).

Previously I founded [Rinodrive](https://www.rinodrive.com) and in 2019 we sold it to [Deepverge](https://www.deepverge.com/). I also previously co-founded The Arbury Foundation (now called [Progressiva](https://www.progressivamagazine.com/)).

Before that I worked as a Marie Curie fellow on [quantum information](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hw0v2bsAAAAJ&hl=en) at
the University of Cambridge and Toshiba, and as an undergrad I worked at Tyndall [modelling quantum systems](http://eoinmurray.github.io/icarusjs).
